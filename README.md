# CMB2play
A small python script to illustrate the how cosmological parameters affect the CMB. The script uses the python implementation of CAMB, which can be found at https://camb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ and http://camb.info. The idea is based on the "Build a Universe!" application, https://wmap.gsfc.nasa.gov/resources/camb_tool/index.html, which can no longer be used after flash player has expired. It further requires to install the healpy package, which can be found at https://healpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. I recommend to create a new python environment before installing camb and healpy with "pip install camb" and "pip install healpy", it may requests specific versions of standard packages.
